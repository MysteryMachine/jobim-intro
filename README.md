## jobim-intro

This project provides a small, complete example of how to write and test
[jobim](https://github.com/MysteryMachine/jobim-intro) applications. Feel
free to use it as a basic template for any work you might need to do.

To run it, on your command line, you can call `lein figwheel test` to
spin up a Figwheel server that will auto-reload any changes made and
run tests for you. To obtain a minified Javascript file ready to be
included anywhere you want, call `lein cljsbuild once min` instead.
